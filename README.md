# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
This analysis focuses on building a filterable table using JavaScript and placing it into an HTML file for easy viewing. We cover customizing the webpage using Bootstrap and equipping the table with functional filters for user interaction. We begin with an introduction to JavaScript and its syntax, followed by working with variables and arrays. Dana learns about the basics of JavaScript and the importance of organizing the code structure before creating JavaScript functions. The data concludes with an overview of JavaScript objects and how to interact with them.

## Results:
### At first glance from opening the page you are greeted with a header, displayed images, article titles, and a descriptive paragraph about UFO's.

## Summary:
  * It would be more beneficial to add additional functions or capabilities for the search function to filter with either lowercases or uppercase letters selected as most of the data is in lowercase and the search is case sensitive. 
  * A keyword search bar could be created for the comments section seeing how lights is referred to many times in the descriptions.
  * Maybe an additional time columns could be added to better track occurences during the time of day according to the dates.
